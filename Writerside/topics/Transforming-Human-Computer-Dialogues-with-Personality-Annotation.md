# Transforming Human-Computer Dialogues with Personality Annotation

**Supervisor:** Prof. Jiaxing Shen

**Type of Project:** Research

**Description:**
- The goal of this research is to create a large-scale dataset of Human-Computer Dialogue (HCD) annotated with detailed personality profiles. Current datasets often fail to distinguish between Human-Human Dialogue (HHD) and HCD, leading to a lack of nuanced data for training personality-aware AI systems. This project will address this gap by fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to transform existing HCD datasets into dialogues that reflect specified personality traits while preserving semantic content. The method involves minimizing deviations in content while maximizing alignment with target personality traits using a dual-objective optimization approach.

- The first step is to explore psychological frameworks like the Big Five and MBTI to identify linguistic features that represent personality traits. These insights will guide the transformation of dialogues, ensuring alignment with target personalities. A comparative analysis of HHD and HCD will then be conducted to understand differences in communication patterns, relational engagement, and personality expression. Using these findings, an automated data enhancement pipeline will be developed to prepare high-quality training data for fine-tuning the LLM. Finally, the fine-tuned model will transform dialogues according to target personalities, evaluated through both human assessments and automated metrics for content fidelity and personality accuracy.

- This dataset will serve as a critical resource for advancing personality-aware AI systems, enabling more natural and empathetic interactions in domains such as education, healthcare, and customer service.
