# Our approach

1. Using psychological frameworks to guide the annotation and transformation of dialogues.
2. Conducting a comparative analysis of HHD vs. HCD to detect how personality traits are expressed differently in these two settings.
3. Building an automated data enhancement pipeline that can produce high-quality, personality-annotated HCD training data.
4. Fine-tuning an LLM to ensure minimal content deviation but strong alignment with a target personality profile.
