## Topic 4: Transforming Human-Computer Dialogues with Personality Annotation
**Supervisor:** Prof. Jiaxing Shen

**Type of Project:** Research

**Description:**  
- The goal of this research is to create a large-scale dataset of Human-Computer Dialogue (HCD) annotated with detailed personality profiles. Current datasets often fail to distinguish between Human-Human Dialogue (HHD) and HCD, leading to a lack of nuanced data for training personality-aware AI systems. This project will address this gap by fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to transform existing HCD datasets into dialogues that reflect specified personality traits while preserving semantic content. The method involves minimizing deviations in content while maximizing alignment with target personality traits using a dual-objective optimization approach.
- 本研究的目标是创建一个大规模的人机对话（HCD）数据集，其中包含详细的个性化配置文件。当前的数据集往往无法区分人机对话（HHD）和HCD，导致缺乏用于训练个性化感知人工智能系统的细致数据。本项目将通过微调大型语言模型（LLM）来填补这一差距，将现有的HCD数据集转换为反映指定个性特征的对话，同时保留语义内容。该方法涉及使用双目标优化方法最小化内容偏差，同时最大限度地与目标个性特征保持一致。

- The first step is to explore psychological frameworks like the Big Five and MBTI to identify linguistic features that represent personality traits. These insights will guide the transformation of dialogues, ensuring alignment with target personalities. A comparative analysis of HHD and HCD will then be conducted to understand differences in communication patterns, relational engagement, and personality expression. Using these findings, an automated data enhancement pipeline will be developed to prepare high-quality training data for fine-tuning the LLM. Finally, the fine-tuned model will transform dialogues according to target personalities, evaluated through both human assessments and automated metrics for content fidelity and personality accuracy.
- 第一步是探索心理框架，如大五和MBTI，以识别代表个性特征的语言特征。这些见解将指导对话的转换，确保与目标个性保持一致。然后将进行HHD和HCD的比较分析，以了解在沟通模式、关系参与和个性表达方面的差异。利用这些发现，将开发一个自动化数据增强管道，为微调LLM准备高质量的训练数据。最后，微调模型将根据目标个性转换对话，通过人工评估和内容忠实度和个性准确性的自动化指标进行评估。

- This dataset will serve as a critical resource for advancing personality-aware AI systems, enabling more natural and empathetic interactions in domains such as education, healthcare, and customer service.
- 该数据集将成为推进个性感知人工智能系统的重要资源，为教育、医疗保健和客户服务等领域提供更自然和富有同理心的互动。

## Topic 5: Dynamic Personality Recognition through Multimodal AI Systems
**Supervisor:** Prof. Jiaxing Shen

**Type of Project:** Research

**Description:**  
- This research focuses on developing a system capable of dynamically recognizing and updating user personality traits during interactions using multimodal data. Traditional approaches rely on static or single-modality methods, limiting their ability to capture the evolving nature of human personalities. This project proposes a Bayesian framework that integrates conversation data (e.g., linguistic patterns) and interaction data (e.g., turn-taking behavior) to provide real-time personality estimates.
- 本研究侧重于开发一个能够通过多模态数据动态识别和更新用户个性特征的系统。传统方法依赖于静态或单模态方法，限制了捕捉人类个性不断发展的能力。本项目提出了一个贝叶斯框架，该框架整合了对话数据（例如，语言模式）和交互数据（例如，轮流行为），以提供实时个性估计。

- The system begins with designing a user-friendly interface that collects multimodal data during interactions without requiring additional hardware, prioritizing conversational behavior over physical cues like facial expressions. The collected data is then processed using a Bayesian model that combines historical and real-time information to refine personality assessments continuously. Conversation data provides insights into linguistic styles, while interaction data captures behavioral patterns such as response times and engagement metrics. The Bayesian model updates its prior estimates with each new interaction round, ensuring that the AI adapts its responses based on evolving user profiles.
- 该系统首先设计了一个用户友好的界面，该界面在交互过程中收集多模态数据，无需额外硬件，优先考虑对话行为而不是面部表情等物理线索。然后，使用贝叶斯模型处理收集的数据，该模型结合了历史和实时信息，以持续完善个性评估。对话数据提供了有关语言风格的见解，而交互数据捕获了响应时间和参与度等行为模式。贝叶斯模型在每一轮新的交互中更新其先验估计，确保AI根据不断发展的用户配置文件调整其响应。

- This dynamic recognition capability enhances user engagement by making interactions feel more natural and personalized. The system's effectiveness will be validated through experiments measuring its ability to predict personality traits accurately across multiple interaction rounds.
- 这种动态识别能力通过使交互更加自然和个性化来增强用户参与度。通过实验验证系统的有效性，衡量其在多轮交互中准确预测个性特征的能力。

## Topic 6: Enabling Consistent Multi-Trait Personality Induction in LLMs
**Supervisor:** Prof. Jiaxing Shen

**Type of Project:** Research

**Description:**  
- This research aims to enable large language models (LLMs) to emulate multiple personality traits consistently and accurately during interactions. Existing methods often focus on single traits or fail to resolve conflicts between multiple traits, leading to inconsistent or disjointed outputs. This project addresses these limitations by generating descriptive adjectives for various traits using domain knowledge (e.g., psychological frameworks) and refining them to eliminate potential conflicts using semantic knowledge graphs like ConceptNet.
- 本研究旨在使大型语言模型（LLMs）在交互过程中一致准确地模拟多种个性特征。现有方法往往专注于单一特征或无法解决多种特征之间的冲突，导致不一致或不连贯的输出。本项目通过使用领域知识（例如，心理框架）生成各种特征的描述性形容词，并使用诸如ConceptNet之类的语义知识图来消除潜在冲突，从而解决这些限制。

- The first task involves generating a vocabulary of adjectives representing each trait based on psychological literature and augmenting it with synonyms from semantic graphs. Potential conflicts among adjectives are identified by analyzing antonyms and removing descriptors that could lead to contradictory outputs when inducing multiple traits simultaneously. These refined adjectives are used as prompts for LLMs to generate coherent summaries of specified personality profiles.
- 第一个任务涉及基于心理文献生成代表每种特征的形容词词汇，并使用语义图中的同义词进行增强。通过分析反义词识别形容词之间的潜在冲突，并删除可能导致在同时诱导多种特征时产生矛盾输出的描述符。这些经过精炼的形容词被用作LLMs的提示，以生成指定个性配置文件的连贯摘要。

- The final step involves evaluating the model's ability to maintain consistent multi-trait personalities across diverse scenarios through both qualitative assessments and quantitative metrics such as coherence scores and user satisfaction ratings. This research will significantly enhance the richness of personality representation in conversational AI, improving trust and engagement in human-computer interactions.
- 最后一步涉及通过定性评估和连贯性评分和用户满意度评分等定量指标评估模型在各种情景下保持一致的多特征个性的能力。这项研究将显著增强对话AI中个性表示的丰富性，提高人机交互中的信任和参与度。

## Topic 11: A sign language interpreter software promoting equal opportunities
**Supervisor:** Prof. LEE Kwan Yeung

**Type of Project:** Application

**Description:**  
- Sign language is the major way of communication for hearing-impaired people. However, sign language is not commonly taught as a second language in schools. As a result, it would often be challenging for hearing-impaired people to communicate with others in daily life. This communication barrier may be resolved if there is sophisticated software that can translate sign language into written language and vice versa. In this project, your team is required to develop software with a user-friendly GUI that can recognize sign language hand gestures in the live video feed captured from a camera and translate these gestures into written language. Your team is also encouraged to explore the possibility of translating written language into sign language hand gestures with generative AI models.

## Topic 12: Automatic diagnosis of the atrial fibrillation with deep learning model
**Supervisor:** Prof. LEE Kwan Yeung

**Type of Project:** Research

**Description:**  
- Atrial fibrillation (AF) refers to the medical condition that the atrial chambers of the heart are beating rapidly and irregularly which can increase the risk of stroke, heart failure, and other heart-related complications. Physicians can confirm their diagnosis of AF by interpreting the standard 12-lead ECG diagram. As a result, if a model can be learned to differentiate the ECG signals of healthy samples from the ECG signals of the AF patients, the diagnosis of AF can hence be automated. In this project, your team is expected to develop deep-learning models for detecting AF. Your team is also expected to conduct experiments to compare the performance of your model against existing models using public datasets.
- 房颤（AF）是指心脏的心房室在快速和不规则地跳动的医学状况，这可能会增加中风、心力衰竭和其他与心脏有关的并发症的风险。医生可以通过解释标准的12导联心电图图来确认他们对AF的诊断。因此，如果一个模型可以学习区分健康样本的ECG信号和AF患者的ECG信号，那么AF的诊断就可以自动化。在这个项目中，您的团队应该开发用于检测AF的深度学习模型。您的团队还应该进行实验，使用公共数据集比较您的模型与现有模型的性能。

## Topic 13: Developing a Policy QA System Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework
**Supervisor:** Prof. Nan LI Nancy

**Description:**  
- Policies are often complex, lengthy, and filled with technical language, making it challenging for individuals to extract the specific information they need efficiently. A policy QA System aims to bridge this gap by providing concise, accurate, and user-friendly answers to policy-related queries. Traditional QA systems typically have pre-defined QA pairs and then use information retrieval techniques to find QA pairs related to users’ questions. As LLM becomes popular, a machine can generate answers without retrieving information. However, generation-based systems often face a significant challenge – hallucinations, where the system generates incorrect or fabricated information that lacks grounding in factual data, which is a critical problem for a policy QA system.
- 政策通常复杂、冗长，并充斥着技术性语言，这使得个人难以高效地提取他们需要的具体信息。政策问答系统旨在通过为与政策相关的查询提供简洁、准确和用户友好的答案来弥合这一差距。传统的问答系统通常具有预定义的问答对，然后使用信息检索技术找到与用户问题相关的问答对。随着LLM的普及，机器可以在不检索信息的情况下生成答案。然而，基于生成的系统往往面临一个重大挑战——幻觉，即系统生成不正确或捏造的信息，缺乏基于事实数据的基础，这对政策问答系统来说是一个关键问题。

- This project addresses the hallucination problem by developing a QA system based on the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. RAG combines the best of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches, aiming to significantly reduce hallucinations in language model outputs by grounding answers in factual, retrieved data. The RAG framework operates through two main components: the retrieved part and the generation part. The retrieval part retrieves relevant policy documents or sections from policy documents on user queries. The generation part synthesizes an easy-to-understand response based on the retrieved content. Unlike standalone generative models that may invent fake details when faced with incomplete information, the RAG approach ensures that all answers are firmly rooted in the retrieved policy data. This enhances the credibility and reliability of the system. An additional challenge in building such a system is balancing speed and accuracy. While users often expect rapid responses, the system must also ensure that answers are precise and factually grounded. Students will explore various techniques to optimize this trade-off, ensuring that the QA system is both efficient and accurate for real-time policy inquiries.
- 本项目通过开发基于检索增强生成（RAG）框架的问答系统来解决幻觉问题。RAG结合了检索式和生成式方法的优点，旨在通过将答案基于事实的检索数据来显著减少语言模型输出中的幻觉。RAG框架通过两个主要组件运行：检索部分和生成部分。检索部分从用户查询中检索相关的政策文件或政策文件的部分。生成部分根据检索到的内容综合出易于理解的响应。与独立的生成模型不同，当面对不完整信息时可能会虚构虚假细节，RAG方法确保所有答案都牢固根植于检索到的政策数据中。这增强了系统的可信度和可靠性。构建这样一个系统的另一个挑战是平衡速度和准确性。虽然用户通常希望快速获得答复，但系统还必须确保答案准确和基于事实。学生将探索各种技术来优化这种权衡，确保问答系统对实时政策查询既高效又准确。
