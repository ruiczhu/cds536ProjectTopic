# Motivation

- Personality-aware AI systems require **nuanced, personality-annotated HCD data** to improve user engagement and adaptability.
- Many dialogue systems (trained primarily on HHD cases) may not capture the different interaction dynamics present in HCD scenarios.
- This gap motivates research aimed at refining or generating dialogue data that explicitly encodes personality traits in HCD.
